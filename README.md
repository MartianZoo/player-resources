This project hosts various resources for players of the superlative 2016 board game [Terraforming Mars](https://www.fryxgames.se/games/terraforming-mars/) from FryxGames.

The idea of using github is to make it easier for you to contribute or just file bugs. We'll see what happens!

### Other MartianZoo resources

I also maintain http://tinyurl.com/tfm-spreadsheet, and bugs can be filed here for that too.

### Other other resources

A resource I *don't* maintain, but which is an *amazing* resource that every player should know about, is http://tinyurl.com/terraforming-mars-faq.

Also, the handiest way to browse cards is https://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list. You might use my spreadsheet for very "spreadsheety" things, but most of the time this way is way more convenient.

### Contributing?

File issues! Send pull requests! Contribute new resources if you made them!

I welcome these contributions. Bear in mind though I am extremely picky about quality control!

### Printability

The text/markdown files wouldn't print well since they have the github header on them. If anyone knows an easy markdown-to-PDF converter, or maybe an easy way to host the htmlified text as a plain old web page, that might be helpful. I'm not good with technology, myself.
