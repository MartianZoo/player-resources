# Terraforming Mars: solo rules summary

## Your goal

Try to score **as many victory points** as you can – but make sure to meet the victory condition in time, or you'll **lose**!

## Before you play

Choose which **game mode** (victory condition) you prefer:

* **Standard Mode**: Win if **every** global parameter track is completed before time runs out (even Venus, if present).
* **TR Mode**: Win if your TR is **63** or higher when time runs out. (See two other rule changes on this page.)

## How it works

Use all rules from the **Corporate Era** multiplayer game, except as modified on this page.

* You'll play a **fixed number of generations**: for the base game, that's **14**. Maxing global parameters **will not** end the game early.
* Victory is checked **immediately** after the final production phase. See the victory condition for the mode you had chosen (above).
* **If you lost**, pack it up! You have no score.
* **If you won**, proceed normally to the final plant conversion phase, and try to score a few more points (**TR Mode**: placing greenery no longer raises oxygen.)

## Other changes

* You begin with **14 TR** instead of 20.
* There are **no milestones or awards**.
* There is a **neutral player**. It doesn't _do_ anything, but it:
    * Counts as a **_player_ or _opponent_** for purposes of any cards[^1] that use those terms.
    * Has infinite **production and resources** of all kinds. When your cards decrease/remove them, the game treats this as having _actually_ happened (for any cards[^2] that care about that).
    * Has 2 **cities**, and a **greenery** next to each, placed randomly on the board (see rulebook page 13, or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ASFqalCUC-XEHLwDCncdA_ufFFW3Yevv/view?usp=sharing)). These are present from the start, yet still trigger Tharsis Republic as if they are played just _after_ it. Do not raise oxygen for these tiles.
* In **TR Mode** only, an extra Standard Project is available, called **Buffer Gas**: pay 16 M€ to increase your TR 1 step.

## Changes by expansion

Either solo mode can be played with any combination of expansions.

* **Venus Next**: To win **Standard Mode**, you must also finish Venus.
* **Prelude**: Play only **12 generations** instead of 14.
* **Colonies**: During initial cards selection: draw 4 colony tiles and return one of your choice. **Decrease M€ production 2 steps.**
* **Turmoil**: The Reds bonus is awarded for a TR of **20** or less.
