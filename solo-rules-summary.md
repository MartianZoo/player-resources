# Terraforming Mars: solo rules summary

## Your goal

Score **as many victory points** as you can – but make sure you meet the victory condition in time, or you'll **lose**!

## Before you play

You have two **game modes** to choose from (no matter which expansions you're using). Each has a different condition for victory.

* **Standard Mode**: You'll win if you complete **every global parameter** before time runs out. (Even Venus, if it's included.)
* **TR Mode**: You'll win if your **TR is 63** or higher when time runs out. (See two other rule changes on this page.)

Choose your mode before you start.

## How it works

Use all rules from the **Corporate Era** multiplayer game, plus any chosen expansions, except as modified on this page.

* You'll play a **fixed number of generations**: for the base game, that's **14**. Completing global parameters **will not** end the game early.
* Victory is checked **immediately** after the final production phase. See your chosen mode's victory condition above.
* **If you lost**, pack it up! Officially, you have no score.
* **If you won**, proceed normally to the final greenery phase, and try to score a few more points. (**TR Mode**: placing greenery no longer raises oxygen.)

## Other changes

* Begin with **14 TR** instead of 20.
* There are **no milestones or awards**.
* There is a **neutral player**. It doesn't _do_ anything, but it:
    * Counts as a **_player_ or _opponent_** for purposes of any cards[^1] that use those terms.
    * Has unlimited **production and resources** of all kinds. Your cards can always decrease/remove them, and the game treats this as having _actually_ happened (for any cards[^2] that care about that).
    * Has 2 **city tiles**, and a **greenery tile** next to each, placed randomly on the board. The placement procedure is too long to summarize here, so follow the rulebook on page 13. These tiles are present from the start, but if you play Tharsis Republic they will still trigger its effect twice. These greenery tiles don't raise the oxygen.
* In **TR Mode** only, an extra Standard Project is available, called **Buffer Gas**: pay 16 M€ to increase your TR 1 step.

## Changes by expansion

Either solo mode can be played with any combination of expansions. (The Corporate Era pseudo-expansion bundled with the base game is required.)

* **Venus Next**: If included, then to win **Standard Mode** you must also finish Venus.
* **Prelude**: If included, play only **12 generations** instead of 14.
* **Colonies**: If included, **decrease M€ production 2 steps**. During initial card selection, draw 4 colony tiles and discard one.
* **Turmoil**: You get the Reds bonus when your TR is **20** or less. Some event cards have special text.
