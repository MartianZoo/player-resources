# Terraforming Mars: Strategy concepts for beginners DRAFT

## Important note

This is just a first draft, and I'm not even a strategy expert (not even close). This document will need a lot of help from strong players. I think it will improve a lot from where it is today, if I can get that kind of review.

Its purpose is not really to tell you very specifically how to win. It's more to arm you with *concepts* and handy names for those concepts, so that you might have new ways of thinking about and discussing strategy. More *vocabulary* for it. However, right now the words I'm using below might be bad choices, so watch out.

I do give some strategy opinions if I'm pretty sure they're non-controversial. For example, spending money on victory points early in the game is not so good. That shouldn't knock anyone's socks off.

## Concepts

**Clock**. The "game clock" is just how much of the way through the game you are: early, middle, or late. The generation track isn't the game clock (except in solo)! To read the clock you have to look at the three global parameters (remember that their progress will accelerate!), and also watch how eagerly or reluctantly players seem to be pushing those parameters. In Terraforming Mars the speed at which the game clock runs is all up to the players, based on how much they terraform.

**Net cost**. Some ability to do mental math is gonna help a lot. Think of a card's cost as its printed cost, minus your discounts, plus the three money you paid for it. Or, once it's already in your hand, technically you should add the 1 money that you could otherwise have sold it for (but this is of little consequence). If the card reduces energy production, of which you don't have a surplus, tack on 11 MC to cover that too.

**Pricing**. When card A gives X more money production than card B, it also *tends* to cost about 5X more than card B. So we say that the game *prices* megacredit production at 5 MC. This absolutely doesn't mean you won't see cards that buck that trend. It also doesn't mean that 5 MC is what the megacredit production is actually *worth* to you! For example, in the final generation it's worth very close to *nothing*.

**Ramping** vs. **Scoring**. When you increase your production, or play blue cards that give ongoing benefits (whether action or effect), you are *ramping*. The alternative to ramping (besides just wasting your money!) is scoring -- putting your money into getting some number of victory points. Note that scoring has an *additive* effect on your final score, but good early ramping has a *multiplicative* effect... and ramping that's way too late will have no effect at all. Of course, when you get TR you are both ramping and scoring. But if it's during a phase of the game when scoring doesn't matter much, then you should evaluate its costs and benefits based on the ramping alone. Looked at that way, early terraforming is quite expensive.

**Bad VPs**. Victory points that you score early in the game. Yes, by the end every VP you have is worth the same, it's true. An extra VP is never *actually* bad. But since VPs are priced at about 4-5 MC, scoring those early ones might have siphoned away some money you needed for *ramping*. You can almost think of these points as if they're *bad* for you -- even though that is definitely an oversimplified mental shortcut. For example, you might think "I'm going to keep Sub-Crust Measurements *despite* its 2 VPs".

**Engine builder**. A player who ramped better than you did, and/or has better sources for non-terraforming VPs than you do (such as animal cards, or maybe cards that draw cards). These players benefit more from longer games, so they might not terraform as much.

**Terraformer**. A player who didn't ramp as well as you did, and/or doesn't have good VP sources. They benefit more from a shorter game, so they are much more likely to terraform as fast as possible. 

**Inflation**. This is the simple idea that money now is better than money later. If someone offered to either give you 10 MC now, or 12 MC next generation, and you were entirely ambivalent, that suggests inflation is about 1.2. Note that as the endgame approaches, inflation becomes very large -- you can't take it with you!

**Break-even point**. By which generation a production-increasing card will have paid itself off. As of that generation you'll have "broken even", but note that you're still at that point worse off for having played it, if it tied up money that could have gone somewhere better.

**Milestone pressure.** Paying 1.6 MC per VP (1 MC per 0.6 VP) is a very high rate of return for this game. In fact, it's high enough to make it appealing even early on when you need to be ramping. However, bear in mind that you are getting that much value only when you achieve the milestone's requirement *naturally*, a.k.a. by making the exact same plays you would have otherwise. When you start changing your drafts/buys/plays specifically to go after the milestone, you're experiencing *milestone pressure*, and you're getting less value for your money.

**Pie**. Victory points that come from milestones, awards, and global parameters are *like a pie*. When you get a bigger slice, other players get less. There's a fixed amount to go out and the question is how much of that you can grab. In a many-player game this might be somewhat true of the board as well. However, you getting more points from cards doesn't really set me back any. Those points are still good for you, but also taking them away from me is better.

**Timing**. A card that is definitely good to play isn't necessarily good to play *now*. For example, if you have 30 MC, and Earth Catapult and Strip Mine in your hand, Earth Catapult might be a fantastic card for you, but it is probably bad *timing* to play it now. Another example is that paying 8 Heat to raise the temperature one step might be a great play for you to make. But unless you have cards with minimum temp requirements, doing that heat bump early in the generation might be bad timing. It might just fulfill another player's requirement, and it might have been just as good for you to save it until the end. 

**Liquidity**. Titanium is not worth 3 money! Only 3 money is worth 3 money, because it's *liquid*. You can spend it on anything. The only time Titanium is really worth 3 MC is when you are *certain* you can spend all of it -- and that you can spend it on the *same cards* you would have played otherwise! Whenever you change your drafting/buying/playing decisions to try to make more use of your titanium, you have **titanium pressure**, and you're not getting full value from it. Of course, every metal you never got to spend was worth exactly *zero!* 3 MC production is almost always superior to 1 titanium production because it generates *liquid* money.

**Dilution**. In the base game, you can do very well from tile points (cities and greeneries). As each expansion offers more ways to earn points, it naturally *dilutes* the value of playing tiles to the board. Similarly, if you usually use only the Venus expansion, you might be used to Venus Waystation being a "strong buy". But adding in more expansions dilutes that card's value.

**Situationality**. The strength of cards in the game is highly situational. When we say that Card A is a "stronger card" than Card B, we really mean that there are more possible game situations where A is worth buying, and fewer possible game situations where B is worth buying. But the strength of the card depends on what situation you're actually in. AI Central can be a terrible card, and (believe it or not) Underground Detonations can be splendid. (Admittedly, in that last case I'm thinking of solo games.) Being able to pass on a great card because it's not great for your particular situation is a very hard skill to learn.

**Latency**. If you buy a card in generation 2, and can't get it to the table until generation 7, that is a *lot* of latency. The card had negative value for all that time.

**Sunk cost**. If you've struggled and sacrificed for five long generations to get to where you can finally play Anti-Grav Tech... it might still be a bad move to play it! It could, depending on the situation, be worth more to you as a patent you can sell for 1 money than as a card you can play. It can be hard to make that decision because of the "sunk cost fallacy". Have plans, pursue those plans... but hold them loosely.

**Placement**. Of course, this is about where you put your tiles on the board; specifically about all the important factors to consider beyond just "what bonus will I collect on this spot?"

**Racing**. In *general* you will probably do just one action on most of your turns, because getting all your moves done quickly isn't *typically* to any advantage of yours. That is, unless you're *racing* for something in particular, such as a track bonus, milestone, coveted city location, or perhaps to get your plants converted before they get nuked. 

**Risk**. You know what risk is. In the context of this game, nothing crystallizes "risk" like buying an early city tile. City tiles are quite expensive, and then depending on what happens, it might be worth 6 VP to you... or none! Then again, by waiting to play it, you risk losing the best locations. Of course, you can mitigate your risks by having a plan for how to get that city surrounded by greeneries.
