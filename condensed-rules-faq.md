# _Terraforming Mars:_ condensed rules FAQ

* On each **turn** you take 1 action, or 2 actions, or drop out. The **generation** continues until all have dropped out.
* **Corporation**, **prelude**, and **project** cards are all _just cards_ and are all played in the exact same way (just at different times). Once played there is no difference between them anymore (so yes, their tags count).
* A **requirement** for a card or milestone only needs to be met at the time you play/claim it. After that it's irrelevant (just like the cost). There are **no exact requirements** in the game; anything that's not a "max" is a "min".
* **Effects and tags** on a card can never help you meet the cost or requirement of that card _itself_. But effects do become active **immediately** after that, so the card's own tags and instructions can trigger them.
* While performing an action, everything you're told to do goes onto your **"to-do list"**, where you can do them in any order you want. Doing one task might _**cause**_ more tasks to be added to the list; just keep going until the list is empty. So, the only ordering rule is that a cause must happen _before its own effect_. Cause-effect examples:
    * Everything to the left of a **red arrow** (action) is the _cause_ of everything to the right of it.
    * Checking the **requirement** and paying the **cost** of a card, together, _cause_ the card to be played.
    * Placing **greenery** _causes_ an oxygen increase, which _causes_ a TR increase.
    * When you see the phrase "Do X **to** do Y", X is the _cause_ of Y. (This is _not_ the case for "Do X **and** do Y".)
* A card can hold **resources** (like microbes) only if it can _use_ those resources in some way (such as for VPs). Multiple resources received in a single batch must always go onto the same card.
* When performing an action or playing a card, you must fully **complete all instructions**. Any choice that would make the action impossible to complete is forbidden. (In practice, you might have to roll back steps you already took). You must follow what every step says to do, but it's not a problem if nothing _actually happens_ as a result. The next three items give examples of this.
* An instruction to **increase a global parameter 1 step** (which includes placing an ocean tile) always means "increase it _IF possible_, and _IF_ you did, then increase TR 1 step too." This is a _special_ fact about global parameters; most instructions are mandatory.
* An instruction to **add resources "to any/another card"** always means to your _own_ card, and always means _"if possible"_! If no card of yours can hold that type, then nothing happens. This is a _special_ fact about card resources; most instructions are mandatory.
* **Removing or stealing resources from "any player"**: This is always optional, unless it's an action cost (like Ants). You can remove any number _up to_ that many. If the card says to **steal**, then you gain/add the resources directly (as a single step). This is the _only_ kind of game instruction that's defined to be always-optional like this!
* In particular: **decreasing production**, removing your _own_ resources, removing a delegate, and an action cost (left of red arrow) are all still **mandatory**! Watch out.
* You get a **track bonus** any time you _raise_ that parameter either _to or past_ that point. If something lowers the track, then later the same bonus could be awarded again.
* When you play an **event (red) card**, its tags will trigger effects and discounts as usual. But once it is played, turn it face-down; its tags will not count anymore.
* All information is **public** except for unplayed cards. You _can_ inspect an opponent's event cards (be reasonable).
* An instruction to **place greenery** always _reminds_ you to raise oxygen too, but don't raise it twice! On the other hand, raising TR is always _separate_, not just a reminder.
* The round yellow **event symbol** (often called "event tag") does not count as being a "tag" for any purpose.
* The **"wild tag"** is also not a tag! You can make it _become_ a tag of your choice for the full duration of any future _action_. (So it helps with milestones, but not awards.) Choose a _real_ tag – not the event symbol or wild symbol, nor even a Venus tag if you're not using that expansion.
* For **World Government Terraforming** and global events: the start player _decides_ what to do, but the steps are performed **as if a neutral player** is doing them.
